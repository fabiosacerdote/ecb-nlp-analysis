# Analysis of European Central Bank's Press Conferences through Natural Language Processing 
## Bachelors' Thesis Project

This project employs Natural Language Processing and computational linguistics techniques to analyze the evolution of the communication style of the European Central Bank’s press conferences. I analyze a dataset of the transcripts of ECB’s press conferences ranging from October 1998 to June 2023. For each press conference, I construct several linguistic measures ideated in existing literature, namely: sentiment, uncertainty, use of constraining language, Hawk-Dove Index, precision, readability, and similarity. In the second part, I provide a qualitative overview and analysis of the resulting linguistic trends. In the final part, I run a time series regression for each linguistic measure with three goals: first, to understand how each linguistic measure reflects the current state of the economy, second, to isolate the effect of relevant macroeconomic and political events in the euro area, like crises, Brexit, and the COVID Pandemic, third, to analyze the individual communication style of each president. The research finds statistically significant results for each of these goals, varying according to the considered linguistic measure.
